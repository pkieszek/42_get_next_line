ðŸ“œ get_next_line

Efficiently reading files, one line at a time!

get_next_line is a 42 School project that challenges students to implement a function that reads from a file descriptor one line at a time, without loading the entire file into memory. This project was a deep dive into memory management, buffers, and file handling in C.

ðŸ”¹ Key concepts learned:
	â€¢	Handling dynamic memory allocation with malloc
	â€¢	Managing a static buffer to optimize file reading
	â€¢	Understanding file descriptors and read() system calls
	â€¢	Avoiding memory leaks and ensuring efficient performance

This project made me appreciate how much thought goes into low-level file handling and how crucial proper memory management is in C. ðŸš€
